# RapidGDML
An open-source Qt-Based application to speed up the coding of material and geometry under Geant4 via its well-developed GUI widgets. Almost of required GDML codes are generated automatically with less hand-effort. The present tool stores all Geant4 simulatiom components defined by user in a SQlite Database which can be used furtherly without redefining them. It also encapsulates a tool for converting STL geometry to its equivalente in tesslated geometry.
